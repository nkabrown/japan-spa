	<p>In Japan, a law was created known as the 'onsenhou' (Hot Spring Law). Based on this law, a natural spring that contains over a defined amount of natural chemical components, and is over a temperature of 25 degrees at its point of release, is officially considered an 'onsen'. There are a number of different onsen categories, according to chemical composition and temperature.</p>
